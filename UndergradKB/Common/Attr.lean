# The `@[kb]` citation attribute

Every headline statement of the knowledge base is tagged with where it comes from:

    @[kb "washington1997" "Theorem 4.2"]
    theorem foo : ... := ...

The first string is a source key of `references.bib`, the second an optional locator inside that
source. Status (proved / stated) is *not* recorded here: it is derived from the kernel (the axioms
of the proof term), so the tag can never claim more than Lean has checked.

This is a local copy of the attribute of LeanKB (`LeanKB/Attr.lean` of
the author's knowledge-base template), same syntax and same data. UndergradKB does not depend on
LeanKB because LeanKB is pinned to Lean `v4.35.0` while UndergradKB follows the Mathlib commit of Tau Ceti
(Lean `v4.36.0-rc2`). When the toolchains agree, this file can be replaced by `import LeanKB`
(the namespace differs: `UndergradKB.kbEntries` here, `LeanKB.kbEntries` there).
